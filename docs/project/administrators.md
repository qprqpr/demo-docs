# Project Owners and Administrators

A project can have any number of administrators, one of them being its owner. Administrators have full permissions within the project except for being unable to remove the project owner.

There are two ways to add a new administrator:

- Knowing their numerical user identifier (user_id), add them using the “Add administrator” button
- Generate an invitation and send the link to your colleague. After they accept the invitation, their data will need to be confirmed.

> **Advice.**
> Many users use nicknames in their accounts. Use the possibility of changing a user’s Display Name so as not to get confused about who is who.
