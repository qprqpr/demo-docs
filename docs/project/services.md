# Services

Gaijin Application Platform offers a range of services allowing the applications in development to use services such as content delivery, matchmaking, leaderboards, inventory, bug reporting, forums and so on.

When necessary, these services are connected to your project. Being that any project needs the content delivery service, the YupMaster GDN service is automatically connected to a new project.
