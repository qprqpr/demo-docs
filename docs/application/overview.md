# Applications

As soon as a project is created, it consists of one application of the same name.

Application - a logical entity, allowing for breaking a project into separate subsystems, each of whom can have its own permissions, its roles, and its own administrators. It is usually enough for a small project to have just one application. Additional applications within a project can be created at any time. Each application is fully independent and in no way affects the other applications.

In which cases will it be convenient to have several applications? If a project consists of several subsystems that are quite independent. For example, a game itself, which may require moderators, community managers or players with the permission to temporarily mute other players. A marketplace may stand alone, having a completely different range of permissions and roles. It will require permissions to manage transactions, refund, modify playersâ€™ inventory and so on.
