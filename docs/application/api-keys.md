# API keys

To make authorized requests to GAP API in the name of the application, you need to generate an API Access token. It can be done at any time in the Tokens section.

You can have a maximum of two active tokens at the same time. Two tokens are necessary in case you need to reissue a token, for example, because the current one was compromised. In this case you can issue a new token, replace the current token with the new one and then remove the previous token, thus making it invalid.

> Attention!
> When generated, the new token should be saved. Once created, it cannot be restored. Only a new one can be issued.
> It is not advisable to generate an access token until you really need it.
